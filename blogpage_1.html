WORKING TITLE: “Sometimes an uncomfortable feeling or situation is needed to find the right direction.” -Dariyan Sim
TOPIC: 
Introduction to my multi-dimensional creative ideas for my personal and education/major-related projects and how I’d branch out from individual creation!
SUMMARY/KEY NOTES: 
Type of projects, what skills will shine, why/reasons behind these projects and where/how they will be promoted.
CONTENT:
As for my personal projects, it’s been long overdue for my stories to be told! I cannot stress enough how many times I have drafted my chapters in varying written forms, from jotting down topic ideas or subjects in a notepad, to scribbling out some changes repeatedly on my Word document, before I temporarily “gave up”-- in order to allow myself a mental reset. So, I could try again with a new plan no matter how long it took. 
I have a great sense of self-awareness and of my surroundings, and can be my worst critic—but currently, I am in a place where my creativity is no longer restricted (regardless of the restriction being self-inflicted or not). I knew I wouldn’t have been able to give it my best shot, if I was under some sort of pressure being rushed or forcing on my contents—it just wouldn’t feel authentic. Authentically me. One of the current courses I’m enrolled in has sparked a great deal of inspiration. An inspiration to develop my own platform to display skill sets and get my stories out. (I enjoy all the courses I’ve taken). 
While I have no issues with self-expression, showcasing my skills, or simply talking about life in general—I’m particular about my work for a reason, any type of work or passion, for many reasons matter of fact. The ability to compile a plan or strategy, as one of the first steps in preparation is great and all, yet still having an open mind that things may not always go as planned, is something I’ve learned throughout my struggles of “explaining who I am”. To avoid being harsh on myself, I decided to take the time to focus one thing at a time, work on my craft with confident and enjoying those moments as well. Enjoying moments, including when mistakes are made, because if I’m passionate about something, I should be consistent. 
One of my main PERSONAL projects that I plan to bring to the table is my “mini-TV series”, with a title in acronym called “HWTH”: written, directed and performed by me. (In current development, title is concealed until I have a full understanding of copyrights with my potential brand-name). “HWTH” is a three-part project that utilizes all three of my ALTER EGOS: deaf side, hard-of-hearing and hearing side of Dariyan. Options to showcase these visuals would be using YouTube and Instagram platforms, which brings to the next subject later in this content.
Details of my THREE-PART ideas--
